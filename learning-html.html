      <p>The API includes 4 functions:

        phrase - Returns a String of a set of unformatted coder ipsum "words". Optionally input the number of "words" to include.
        sentence - Returns a String of a set of coder ipsum "words" in the format of a sentence - with capitalization and period punctionation. Optionally input the number of "words" to include.
        paragraph - Returns a String of a set of coder ipsum "words" in the format of a paragraph with multiple sentences, including capitalization and period punctionation. Optionally input the number of sentences to include. Sentences will have 6-10 "words" each.
        madLib - Returns a string of a Mad-Libs-like fake sentence with nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., using the same base word set of coder-inspired language.
        Note that some "words" are more than one word like "Lil' Bobby Tables".
        
        Both phrase and sentence will randomly pick 6-10 "words" if no input is given. paragraph will randomly generate 3-5 sentences within the paragraph if no input is given.
        
        Examples:
        
        const myPhrase = phrase(4)
        // => JQuery pairing tech debt queue
         
        const mySentence = sentence(7)
        // => XML perf matters public Safari transpile tabs vs spaces OTP.
         
        const myParagraph = paragraph(2)
        // => Byzantine fault tolerance S3 homebrew spy object library callback hell flexbox idiosyncratic contexts scale gradle. Mock dynamic types GraphQL domain specific language modern bundle terminal proof of stake AWS responsive.
         
        const madLibs = paragraph(2)
        // => If we promise the void, we can get to the S3 module through the stateless big O  </p>
